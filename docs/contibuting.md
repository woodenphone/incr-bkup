# How to contibute
I don't fucking know.

Just go and make shit.

If you make it easy to merge in your changes I might do that.

Don't make weird changes to things that will mess with me easily doing things if you want me to consider your pull requests.

If my comfy flat dir structure is turned into some garbage with src/ bin/ and whatnot you will probably be rejected.
